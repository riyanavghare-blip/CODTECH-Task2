OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
PROJECT:Python script showcasing input text and concie summaries.

How the script works
The script follows these steps to create a summary:
Tokenization: Breaks the input text into sentences and individual words.
Word frequency scoring: Builds a frequency table of all the words in the text, after filtering out common "stop words" like "the" or "a."
Sentence scoring: Assigns a score to each sentence based on the sum of the frequencies of its words.
Summary generation: Selects the top-ranking sentences to create the final, concise summary.
